# To-do-list


Project Overview
The Advanced Task Manager is a Python-based application that allows users to efficiently manage tasks with features like task prioritization, due dates, and completion tracking. The application utilizes Linked Lists, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees (BSTs) for optimized task storage and retrieval. Additionally, a user-friendly graphical interface is built using Tkinter.

Features
- Add, delete, and search tasks.
- Sort tasks based on priority (High, Medium, Low).
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete.
- Store tasks efficiently using data structures.
- Graphical User Interface for better usability.


How to Run
1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
python 8.py

│── Task_Manager_Report.pdf # Detailed report

How It Works
1. The user enters a task description, priority level, and optional due date.
2. Tasks are stored in a linked list and indexed in a hash table for quick retrieval.
3. A binary search tree (BST) sorts tasks based on priority.
4. Users can view all tasks in the GUI, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, or search for specific tasks.
5. The interface updates dynamically to reflect changes.
